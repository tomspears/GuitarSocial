# GuitarSocial Protoype work in progress - 
#
# Guitar Education Social App
#
# A small social app that connects teachers and content creators with students in a familiar way
#
# The idea is to strip the concept of social media down to a more specific purpose - in this case guitar education - and build vertically along that purpose
# By stripping most of what we know as "social media" down to some basic functions - we can build tools for students and educators that 
# deepen remote connections and allow for a more interactive and community-based environment for learning. 
# 
# My idea here is to "meta" music school - and allow accomplished entertainers, professional educators, and local bar guitar heros a level playing field while
# providing the same equality of access to students across the globe. 
#
# What starts as a platform for guitar education can then be easily scaled to other areas of discpline. 
#
# Planned features include fully synchronous video chat for live lessons and seminars, hosted storage for teacher content with a monetization feature that allows content creators # to sell access to custom lessons, and a global calendar of events to show upcoming special seminars hosted by the world's leading music educators
